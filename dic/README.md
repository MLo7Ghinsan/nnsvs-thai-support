TH_Tble_MLo7 is a custom table

Originally written for NNSVS Thai language adaptation.
There are unneccessary/unused words and phonemes combination present in the table, it wouldn't affect the model if there is no data for them (since they wouldn't be used with original lyrics anyway).

cNp is the self note and "copy and paste" table that were used when wriiting TH_Table_MLo7.
The number were "replacing" material
